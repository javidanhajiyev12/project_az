Project AZ is a barcode management web application designed for product verification and tracking. The system enables users to:
📷 Scan barcodes using a device camera
✍ Enter barcodes manually
🔍 Validate barcodes through a backend system
📸 Capture and upload product images
📥 Generate and download Excel reports
The frontend is built using HTML and JavaScript with the html5-qrcode library, while the backend is powered by Python (Flask) for barcode validation, image handling, and Excel file generation.
